# Voice-based-Stress-Detection-System
Developed a voice-based stress detection system using MFCC and time-series features to analyze speech signals and identify stress levels. The model processes audio inputs, extracts acoustic features, and applies machine learning techniques to classify stress, enabling real-time emotional state monitoring.
